Assignment overview: You need to write two programs in C. The first one, named <i>checker</i>, takes integer arguments and reads instructions on the standard output. Once read, checker executes them and displays <b>OK</b> if integers are sorted. Otherwise, it will display <b>KO</b>. The second one, called <i>push_swap</i>, calculates and displays on the standard
output the smallest number of movements needed to sort the integer arguments received (using only the given instruction list).
The only authorised functions are: write, read, malloc, free, exit.
